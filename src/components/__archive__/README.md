# Archived Comment Components

This folder contains previous iterations of the `Comments` component for integrating [`@giscus/react`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@giscus/react). These versions are archived for reference, debugging, and documentation purposes.

Only the final version (`components/Comments.tsx`) is used in production.

---

## üì¶ Files

### `Comments.legacy-author.tsx`

- ‚úÖ **Original version** suggested by theme author.
- Uses `localStorage` and `prefers-color-scheme` to determine initial theme.
- Adds manual listener for `#theme-btn` click.
- Also listens to system theme changes (`matchMedia(...).addEventListener(...)`).
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Can cause **hydration mismatch** on first render.

---

### `Comments.hydration-safe.tsx`

- ‚úÖ Fixes hydration mismatch.
- Initializes theme with fixed value (`"light"`), then corrects it on mount.
- Reads from `data-theme` attribute on `<html>`.
- Does not react to theme changes after initial render.
- Suitable when **Giscus only needs to match initial theme**.

---

### `Comments.with-theme-hook.tsx`

- ‚úÖ Uses `useThemeFromHtml()` custom hook.
- Observes `data-theme` changes with `MutationObserver`.
- Updates Giscus theme reactively (e.g., when user toggles dark/light mode).
- Most robust and automatic version prior to extracting into reusable hook.
- Used as the base for the final production component.

---

## ‚úÖ Final Component

The latest and active version is located at: components/Comments.tsx

It uses the extracted hook:

```ts
import { useThemeFromHtml } from "@/hooks/useThemeFromHtml";
```

## üóÇÔ∏è Notes
